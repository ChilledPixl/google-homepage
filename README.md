This assignment is a task to reproduce Google's homepage.

26/01/19 - Close to finishing assignment after around two hours. Work was mostly completed solo with a quick debug question asked to a friend and references used online to make sure the correct coding was used. Will tweak to improve over time. 

30/01/19 - Happy with the final result on the homepage. Could do with some polishing but at this stage, it's okay. Started work on optional assignment in rebuilding the Google search result page.

05/02/19 - Haven't been working on the assignment for a few days as have had late shifts at work. Mostly finished the final assignment in recreating the search page. Project taking longer than usual as I'm extremey intent in trying to match any and most elements exact, even down to small details. Plus, I get distracted very easily lol.
