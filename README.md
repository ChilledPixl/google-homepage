This assignment is a task to reproduce Google's homepage.

26/01/19 - Close to finishing assignment after around two hours. Work was mostly completed solo with a quick debug question asked to a friend and references used online to make sure the correct coding was used. Will tweak to improve over time. 

30/01/19 - Happy with the final result on the homepage. Could do with some polishing but at this stage, it's okay. Started work on optional assignment in rebuilding the Google search result page.

05/02/19 - Haven't been working on the assignment for a few days as have had late shifts at work. Mostly finished the final assignment in recreating the search page. Project taking longer than usual as I'm extremey intent in trying to match any and most elements exact, even down to small details. Plus, I get distracted very easily lol.  

12/02/19 - Finally had some time after a busy work schedule to finish up the harder project. There's some small things that can be added but overall, I think I've spent Well enough time on both of these webpages and I think it's time to move on further into the course. I'll definitely revisit these over time to tweak them to perfection but for now, I'm more than happy with how they have come out for experience.

For reference, the following two links are what I was using to recreate my own pages:

Easy Google homepage: www.google.com
Harder Google results page: https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage
