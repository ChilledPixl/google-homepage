This assignment is a task to reproduce Google's homepage.

26/01/19 - Close to finishing assignment after around two hours. Work was mostly completed solo with a quick debug question asked to a friend and references used online to make sure the correct coding was used. Will tweak to improve over time. 

30/01/19 - Happy with the final result on the homepage. Could do with some polishing but at this stage, it's okay. Started work on optional assignment in rebuilding the Google search result page.
